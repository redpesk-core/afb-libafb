#if WITH_CRED

/**
 * Check if the credential associated with the request 'req'
 * are including a granted access to the permission.
 *
 * This check is by nature asynchronous because the permission
 * is granted by an foreign process (an authority).
 *
 * The result of the check is given to the callback. Precisely,
 * the callback receives 2 values: the closure given at the call
 * and the status of the check. The values of the check status are:
 *
 *      - 0 if the permission is denied
 *      - 1 if the permission is granted
 *      - negative if some error occurred during the processus
 *
 * Optimization allows to cache requested permission if possible.
 * If the answer is cached, the callback can be called immediately
 * before returning.
 *
 * @param req request whose credential are to be used for the check
 * @param permission the permission to be checked
 * @param callback the callback that receives the status
 * @param closure the closure passed back to the callback
